# Introduction to VAE and Fashion MNIST

*Inspired by the book "Deep Learning with Python" by Fran√ßois Chollet*

The **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** is a type of generative model used in machine learning and deep learning. It is particularly useful for tasks like data generation, image reconstruction, and feature learning. The **Fashion MNIST** dataset serves as a suitable candidate for applying VAE.

## Fashion MNIST Dataset

Fashion MNIST is a dataset comprising grayscale images of clothing and fashion items. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images across ten different classes, each representing a different fashion item such as shoes, dresses, or t-shirts. The dataset is widely used in machine learning for image classification tasks and, in this context, for VAE-based generative modeling.

## The Problem

The problem addressed here is to leverage a Variational Autoencoder to learn a compact, continuous latent space representation of the Fashion MNIST images. VAEs are designed to capture the underlying structure in data and enable the generation of new, similar data samples from this learned latent space.

## Import necessary libraries and modules

 - `import tensorflow as tf`: This line imports the TensorFlow library, which is a widely-used deep learning framework. It's necessary for building and training the machine learning model.

 - `from tensorflow.keras.datasets import fashion_mnist`: This line imports the Fashion MNIST dataset from the TensorFlow.keras.datasets module. Fashion MNIST contains grayscale images of various clothing items and accessories, making it a suitable dataset for machine learning.

- `from tensorflow.keras.models import Model`: This line imports the Model class from the Keras library. Keras is a high-level neural network API that operates on top of TensorFlow. The Model class will be used to define the architecture of the machine learning model.

 - `from tensorflow.keras import layers`: This line imports various layers and components from Keras. These layers are essential for constructing the neural network model, including dense layers and convolutional layers.

 - `from tensorflow import keras`: This line imports the Keras subpackage from TensorFlow. Keras is a user-friendly and high-level framework for creating and training neural networks. It integrates seamlessly with TensorFlow, a lower-level deep learning framework.

 - `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`: This line imports the Matplotlib library, which is commonly used for data visualization. Matplotlib will be used to display images and plots during the training and evaluation of the machine learning model.

 - `import numpy as np`: This line imports the NumPy library, which is essential for numerical operations in Python. It supports arrays, matrices, and various mathematical operations, making it crucial for data processing in machine learning.

## Load the Fashion MNIST dataset


- `(x_train, _), (x_test, _) = fashion_mnist.load_data()`: This code segment loads the Fashion MNIST dataset using the `fashion_mnist.load_data()` function. The dataset is divided into training (`x_train`) and testing (`x_test`) sets. The corresponding labels are loaded but not used in this code snippet.


- `x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255`: These lines normalize the pixel values in the training dataset (`x_train`). First, the pixel values are cast to floating-point numbers to ensure accurate calculations. Then, each pixel's value is divided by 255, scaling them to the range [0, 1]. This normalization is a common preprocessing step in machine learning.

- `x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255`: Similar to the previous explanation, these lines normalize the pixel values in the testing dataset (`x_test`) by casting to float and scaling to the range [0, 1].

- `x_train = x_train[..., tf.newaxis]`: These lines add a channel dimension to the images in the training dataset. The `tf.newaxis` operation introduces a new dimension to represent grayscale images. Typically, grayscale images have a single channel (as opposed to RGB images, which have three channels). This step prepares the data for input to a model that expects images in this format.

- `x_test = x_test[..., tf.newaxis]`: Similar to the previous explanation, these lines add a channel dimension to the images in the testing dataset, ensuring consistency with the training dataset.

- `latent_dim = 200`: This line defines the dimension of the latent space, which is set to 200. In the context of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), the latent space represents a compressed and continuous representation of the input data. The dimension of the latent space is a hyperparameter that can be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the model and the dataset.
